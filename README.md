## Potato Leaf disease c lassification using deep learning

Agriculture is the cultivation of land and raising of crops to produce food. It is a form of subsistence farming that has been practised for thousands of years. With the advancement in technology and the use of artificial intelligence in diagnosing plant diseases, it becomes important to make pertinent research toward sustainable agricultural development. In the past, diagnosis of plant diseases was done by observing the symptoms of a diseased plant. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence and its application to agriculture, it has become important to make pertinent research in this area. With the use of image processing and deep learning algorithms, it is now possible to diagnose a plant disease by using a picture taken from a smartphone. 
In this project we demonstrate how we can use convolutional neural networks to make Potato Disease Prediction.
